= Detailed Page Reporting =

Sort your page reports by their Page Speed Score to prioritize the largest areas of opportunity on your site. Page reports utilize easy to read visualizations that allow you to quickly focus in on the most important data to improve your sites performance.

= Report Summaries =

Report Summaries are a powerful and exclusive feature of Google Pagespeed Insights for WordPress. Summaries display your average Page Score, largest areas for improvement across ALL reports, as well as best and lowest performing pages. Report summaries can be filtered to narrow results by: Pages, Posts, Categories, Custom URLs, and Custom Post Types.

Using Report Summaries allows you to ‘zoom out’ from the page-level and better understand the big picture of your sites performance.

= Desktop and Mobile Page Reports =

Best practices for site performance differ greatly between Desktop and Mobile device usage. Configure Google Pagespeed Insights for WordPress to generate Desktop reports, Mobile reports, or both!

Toggle back and forth between report types to see specific suggestions for improving the performance and experience on each platform.

== Troubleshooting ==

**Please find the below list of potential issues that you may encounter, and the recommended next steps.**

= I entered my API Key and saved the Options, but no Reports are showing up in the Report List. =

- Google Pagespeed needs to be able to load each page to create its report. Make sure that your pages are publicly accessible over the internet.
- Ensure that your API key is entered correctly, and that you have enabled the "PageSpeed Insights API" from the Google API Console.
- If problems persist, your server may not support the default method used to check pages. There are two alternate methods available that you can try.
	1. Navigate to the "Options" tab
	2. Expand the "Advanced Configuration" section.
	3. Find the "Scan Technique" dropdown
	4. Try "Ajax" next, If problems persist try "Session Flush"
	5. Click "Save Options &amp; Check Pages

= An error was reported while trying to check one of my pages, and it has been added to the Ignored Pages section. =

- Navigate to the Ignored Pages tab, find the page, and click "reactivate" to try it again.
- If the page fails again, ensure that the page is publicly accessible from the internet. Non-public pages cannot be checked.
- In some rare cases, pages are not able to be scanned by the Pagespeed API. Try checking your page manually here: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/. If the page fails to be checked, report the issue to Google so that they can diagnose further.

= I received a Javascript or PHP error. =

- If the error appeared while Google Pagespeed was checking pages, you may have loaded the page while it was storing data. Refresh the page in a couple seconds to see if the issue has gone away.
- If issues persist please report the problem with as much information as you can gather, including: What page you were on, the exact text of the error, or a screenshot of the error.
- In the Options page, under "Advanced Configuration" there is a checkbox called "Log API Exceptions". Any API exception that is not caught and handled automatically will be stored to a log file. This log information can be very helpful when diagnosing issues

= Page report checks never finish all of the way, I have to press "Save Options & Check Pages" again and again to get it to finish checking all of my pages. =

- If the reports seem to always run for a certain length of time before stopping unexpectedly, you may be exceeding your servers Max Execution time. Try increasing the value in Options->Advanced Configuration "Maximum Execution Time". Note: If PHP is running in safe mode your Max Execution time cannot be changed from this option, you may need to contact your server administrator for further assistance.
- If problems persist, your server may not fully support the default method used to check pages. There are two alternate methods available that you can try.
	1. Navigate to the "Options" tab
	2. Expand the "Advanced Configuration" section.
	3. Find the "Scan Technique" dropdown
	4. Try "Ajax" next, If problems persist try "Session Flush"
	5. Click "Save Options &amp; Check Pages

= My Page Scores seem really low. When I click "Recheck Results" when viewing Report Details, the score jumps up dramatically. =

- Your server may have been responding slowly when the first report was generated. A slow server response time can have a large impact on your Page Speed Score. If these problems happen frequently you may want to talk with your hosting provider about the problem, or look into alternative hosting providers.

= I want to clear out all of the current page reports and start over. =

1. Navigate to the "Options" tab
2. Expand the "Advanced Configuration" section.
3. Find the "Delete Data" Dropdown
4. Select "Delete Reports Only" to remove all Page Reports
5. Or Select "Delete EVERYTHING" to remove all Page Reports, Custom URLs, Snapshots, and Ignored Pages

== Screenshots ==

1. Filter reports by Pages, Posts, Category Indexes, or Custom Post Types. Sort Report Lists by Page Score to see your highest and lowest performing pages.
2. Separate reports for Desktop and Mobile page reports. Check each report to receive platform specific recommendations to increase your sites performance.
3. Configure Google Report Language, Report Types, and choose which Wordpress URLs to run reports on.
